The SOG-code-collab repository contains the source code and support files for the 
SOG 1-D biophysical coupled near-surface mixing model of the Strait of Georgia.
The model was created by the Mesoscale Ocean and Atmospheric Dynamics (MOAD) group in the
Department of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences (EOAS) at the
University of British Columbia (UBC).

The files in this repository are made available to facilitate collaboration on model development
and adaptation of the model for other regions and scenarios.
If you are interested in collaborating on SOG,
please contact Dr. Susan Allen (sallen@eoas.ubc.ca).
