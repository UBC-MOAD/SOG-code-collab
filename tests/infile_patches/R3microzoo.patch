# SOG infile patch to produce a testcase infile from the repository infile

# This patch is used by buildbot.

# It was created with:
#    $ cd SOG
#    $ cat tests/infile_patches/patch_comments >> path_to/patch_file
#    $ diff -u infile path_to/sample_new_file >> path_to/patch_file

#  To apply this patch manually, do:
#    $ cd SOG
#    $ patch -i path_to/patch_file -o path_to/new_infile

# where:
#   - tests/infile_patches/patch_comments contains these comments
#   - path_to/patch_file is the path and name of this file
#   - path_to/new_infile is the path and the name of the new infile to be
#     created.
