List of tags in this project's repository and their meaning:

UBC_EOS	- VENDOR_TAG used for initial import

v1_9	- RELEASE_TAG used for initial import

v1_9_1	- rev where the code successfully compiles and execute with
	  pgf90: FFLAGS = -O0 -g -Mbounds -Mdclchk -Mstandard -Minform=warn
	  g95: FFLAGS = -O0 -g -fimplicit-none -fbounds-check -ftrace=full -Wall

v2_0    - headers added to profile results file so that profiles can be
          analyzed and compared using compareSOG
	- several critical bugs, mostly found by Susan, corrected
	- physics results agree well with kcollins_06 on coho, but
          there are still small differences between results on coho
          and on ludwig/clara

before_FLAGELLA_merge - immediately before starting to merge code from
                        Nilgun's FLAGELLA project

after_FLAGELLA_merge - immediately after completing merge of code from
                       Nilgun's FLAGELLA project 
		     - includes flag to turn flagellates on/off which
                       changes the initial biomass value, and selects
                       one of 2 derivs_* subroutines for odeint to
                       use; all of this is expected to be temporary
                       code

SOG_created - project name changed to SOG from dlatornell_NH4

EPOC_2006 - immediately before code was branched to do the runs for
            the paper presented at the EPOC 2006 conference
            (TImberline Lodge, Mt. Hood, OR)

EPOC_2006_branch - code was branched to do EPOC 2006 conference paper
                   runs so that refactoring and development could
                   continue on the trunk
