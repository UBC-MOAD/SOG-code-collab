  subroutine upwelling_profile
    ! Calculate the vertical profile of the entrainment velocity based
    ! on the river flow, and the maximum freshwater upwelling
    ! velocity.  The latter is a function of the river flow, and is
    ! calculated in the surface_flux subroutine.  The details of the

    ! in late June 2006.

    ! Three models for the upwelling variation depth have been used:
    !   1. Use a value based on the current salinity profile. Found to
    !      be not sufficiently stable. See code version 1.8 for
    !      calculation of d from the salinity profile.
    !   2. Set the depth of 68% fresh water content to the fit found
    !      in entrainment.pdf.
    !   3. A value of d calculated according to entrainment.pdf for
    !      the specific estuary being modeled is read from the infile.

  subroutine upwelling_advection (dt, qty, advection)
    ! Calculate the vertical advection of a quantity based on the
    ! vertical profile of the entrainment velocity.  Note that the
    ! vertical velocity decreases as the surface is approaches and so
    ! water and property is squeezed out the sides of the water column.
