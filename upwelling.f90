module find_upwell
  ! Subroutines that calculate the vertical profile of entrainment
  ! velocity (upwelling), and the vertical advection of quantities (T,
  ! S, etc.).
  !
  ! Public Subroutines:
  !
  ! upwell_profile(grid, S, upwell, wupwell)
  !   -Calculate the vertical profile of the entrainment velocity based
  !    on the salinity profile, and the maximum upwelling velocity.
  !
  ! vertical_advection(grid, dt, property, wupwell, gvector)
  !   -Calculate the vertical advection of a quantity based on the
  !    vertical profile of the entrainment velocity.

  subroutine upwell_profile(grid, S, upwell, wupwell)
    ! Calculate the vertical profile of the entrainment velocity based
    ! on the salinity profile, and the maximum upwelling velocity.
    ! The latter is a function of the Fraser River flow, and is
    ! calculated in the surface_flux subroutine.  The details of the
    ! model to do this are in the the document entrainment.pdf written
    ! in late June 2006.

  subroutine vertical_advection (grid, dt, qty, wupwell, gvector)
    ! Calculate the vertical advection of a quantity based on the

    ! vertical velocity decreases as the surface is approaches and so
    ! water and property is squeezed out the sides of the water column.
