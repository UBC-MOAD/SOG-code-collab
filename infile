! SOG code infile template

! SOG code infile for 300 hr run starting at cruise 04-14 station S3
! CTD cast (2004-10-19 12:22 LST).  This file is primarily used for
! quick tests during code development and refactoring.

! Run timing parameters:
! Date/time at which the run starts (must match a CTD profile date/time)
! *** This should be replaced with a calendar date & clock time, 
! *** ideally on 1 line
"year_o"	2004	"year in which the run starts"
"month_o"	10	"month in which the run starts"
"yr_day_o"	293	"year-day on which the run starts [1-Jan = 1]"
"t_o"		44520	"day-second at which the run starts [midnight = 0]"
! Duration of run in seconds
! *** This should be replaced with another date/time
"run_dur"	1124520. "run duration [s]"
